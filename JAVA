* java : it is a oops(object oriented programming language)
* extension : .java
* java is platform independent
* jvm : converts bytes code into machine code
* execution : .java -->x.class-->jvm(it will identify the microprocessor)
* JVM : in that system will convert these byte code instructions into machine code which is understadable by any processor
ex : spark and pentium
JAVA INTRODUCTION:
* 1990 : Sun microsystem(green project)
* 1991 : bill joy, james gosling,mike sneradin,
patric k naughton
FEATURES OF JAVA:
1> simple programming language (it works on electronic device)
* pointers are not there in java so it become easy to understand
* security is more
2> java is a object oriented programming  language(it is concept of class and object)
* object : real world existance (ex: every human being ,a book)
ex: dog(name,height,age(variables))(running,barking(methods))
properties of object : variables(property) and methods(actions)*
* a group of objects exhibiting same bahaviour(properties+actions) will come under the same group called as class
class--> variables-->methods-->objects
-- class dog
name
age
height
eating(){
}
barking(){
}--
3> java is  not purely object oriented language b/c it will contain primitive data types like int,float...
purely oops means : it will contains only classes and objects ,it should not contain primitive data type(int,float,char.)
* multiple inheritance does not exist
JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE(JVM):
* This is the heart of entire java program execution process
x.java-->x.class(contains byte code)it will not understand by us so jvm converts into understandabe code
ARCHITECTURE OF JVM:
              CLASS LOADER(class files are load into memory)
1               2        3             4          5
METHOS AREA     HEAP     JAVA STACK    PC REG.     NETIVE METHOD STACK
(class code)  (objs are   (memory       (save        
                 created)  allocation)    address)  
     6            7
interpreter    jit compiler(it increase the speed of execution of java program)
